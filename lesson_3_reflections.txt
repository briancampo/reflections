When would you want to use a new repository instead of keeping all your changes local?

To allow for a project with other members and to provide other developers to see what I am working on for insight


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe because you want to be able to retain a feature that is not ready for public exposure.
