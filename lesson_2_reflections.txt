What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need it?

It creates a .git folder.
That is where all the git metadata is stored


How is the staging aread different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is different because it is not yet added to the repository. 
It allows you a place to pull in all your files before you add them to the repository.
