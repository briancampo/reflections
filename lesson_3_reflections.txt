When would you want to use a new repository instead of keeping all your changes local?

To allow for a project with other members and to provide other developers to see what I am working on for insight


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe because you want to be able to retain a feature that is not ready for public exposure.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

forks are clones done in github, clones are copies of a repository, and branches are discrete paths for code. When you are doing those operations


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It allows you to see where the remote repository code is at as well as compare it with your local code


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier and what would be harder?

I would have to use Google Docs or DropBox.  It would be much harder because it doesn't provide many features like diff and forks, and even pull requests.
